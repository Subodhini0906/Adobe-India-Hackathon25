## Welcome to the "Connecting the Dots" Challenge

### Rethink Reading. Rediscover Knowledge

What if every time you opened a PDF, it didn't just sit there—it spoke to you, connected ideas, and narrated meaning across your entire library?

That's the future we're building — and we want you to help shape it.

In the Connecting the Dots Challenge, your mission is to reimagine the humble PDF as an intelligent, interactive experience—one that understands structure, surfaces insights, and responds to you like a trusted research companion.
